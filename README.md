## Setup

**Step 1:** Install Git LFS. 

You can download it from the [Git LFS website](https://git-lfs.github.com/) or if you are on macOS and use Homebrew, you can install it via the terminal with:

```bash
brew install git-lfs
```

For Linux, you can use:

```bash
sudo apt-get install git-lfs
```

**Step 2:** Initialize Git LFS

After you have Git LFS installed, you need to set it up for use with your Git repository. Navigate to your repository's directory in the terminal and execute:

```bash
git lfs install
```
