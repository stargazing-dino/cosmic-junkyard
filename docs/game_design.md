# Game Design Document: "Cosmic Junkyard"

## 1. Game Concept:

Cosmic Junkyard is a strategic physics-based puzzle game where players move and transform planets to manipulate the path of an object. The game challenges players' understanding of gravity and spatial relationships. The object's trajectory is solely determined by the gravitational pull of the player-controlled planets.

## 2. Gameplay Mechanics:

- The player controls multiple planets which can be moved and transformed. They can set the planet's position and mass.
- The player cannot directly control the object but can influence its trajectory by manipulating the position and mass of planets.
- Each level requires the player to guide an object from the from one area on the map to another using only the gravitational pull of the planets.
- Players can achieve this by setting up planets to act as a gravity slingshot, bouncing the object between them, or by creating a gravitational path.
- The levels get progressively more complex, introducing more planets, different obstacles, and new features.

## 3. Objectives:

- The primary goal of each level is to get the object from one area on the map to the other marked the goal.
- Secondary goals could include completing the level within a certain time frame, using a minimum number of moves, or collecting bonus items en route.

## 4. Controls:

- The player can select a planet by clicking on it.
- Dragging a selected planet will move its position.
- To change a planet's mass, players can use a slide bar or a simple '+' and '-' interface.

## 5. Visual Style:

- The game will use a minimalist style with simple, yet aesthetically pleasing graphics.
- Planets can be visually distinct and grow in size as their mass is increased.
- The object and the target location could have glowing effects to differentiate them from the background and planets.

## 6. Sound and Music:

- Calm and space-themed background music will accompany the gameplay.
- Sound effects for planet movements, object bouncing, and reaching the goal will provide feedback for the player.

## 7. Level Design:

- The initial levels will serve as a tutorial, teaching players how to control the planets and explaining the basic concept of gravity and slingshot mechanics.
- As the game progresses, levels become more complex with added obstacles, such as black holes, comets, or other celestial bodies that may alter the object's path.
- Some levels may provide additional challenges by restricting the transformation ability of planets (for example, their position or mass).

## 8. Monetization:

- I dunno

## 9. Platforms:

- The game will be developed for anything Bevy compiles to.
- Touchscreen controls for mobile and mouse controls for PC will make it accessible for a broad audience.
